I know, yet another temperature monitor ...
This is my first complete project that involves CAD design, 3D printing, electronics prototyping, C code (I am not a developer ;) and webhooks.

Goals of this project : 
- Getting temperatures from the 3 sensors (AC, back of the cabinets and ambient) 
- Log the temperatures and graph these to monitor trends overtime.
- Send alerts when a level is reached.

I initially prototyped the temperature monitor using the typical breadboard :
